# Class 03: Git and Github

## Review

Takeaways from the yesterdays afternoon lecture.

  - Robert: save your work!! (power outage / lost work :( ).
  - Nicholas: walking away is good (most times).
  - Leisl: Google is your friend!  Good place to practice your question asking.
  - Ella: Take risks and make mistakes (Facebooks).
  - Brady: A million different ways / formats / tools used for code.
  - Jacob: Our machine makes a bigs difference (runtime environment).  It's very important to have a well configure development environment.

## VS Code extensions that I love

- Eslint (linting our javascript).
- Markdown all in One (markdown preview / foramtting).
- live-server (deploys our HTML / CSS / JS in a local testing environment).
- live-share (allows remote developers to see and edit the same files on a local machine).
- atom-keymap (uses the kay bindings that the atom code editor used).

## Git

- What is Git?  A version control system??
