# Markdown

It is a syntax - consistent pattern of characters.  The order of the characters makes markdown.

Programs that can understand these characters provide the `semantics`.

VS code knows this is markdown, because it ends in `.md`.

## Octothorpe - Designates Headings

A list of things markdown can do.(there are double spaces right after this to do another line break)  
But more text should appear below this paragraph.
- Level one heading uses octothorpe.
- Each dash is a bullet.

## Publishing Markdown

Gihub allows any markdown that is published in a repository (a big folder).

- markdown can be publishe using github pages: repo > settings > pages (on the side menu)
- Select the `main` branch of the repo you want to publish.
- Use `/root` as the publishing folder.
  - By default, any README.md file will be used as the markdown to turn into HTML.
