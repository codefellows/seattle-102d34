## What is JS

Each of the languages we've discussed has a purpose. HTML -> content, CSS -> look, JS -> behavior.
If you hover your mouse over something and something else happens JavaScript makes that happen.  JS is a programming langauge.

- Programming language: langauge that we use to tell computer what to do. Using the data and features that computers have available to them.
- Syntax is relatively straight forwards language.

Fundamental concepts
- Data Types
  - String: group of text character, used to represent natural langauge
    - Hello my name is J4cob
    - a => Hello
  - Number: a qunititive value, represent all integers, decimals, fractions
    - 1
    - 1/2
    - 4.5
    - -4000
  - Boolean: True and False
    - truthiness and falsiness javascript can evaluate certain things as true or false, without explicitly set as true or fasle.
  - null and undefined.
- Browser behaviors
  - All Javascript that is executed by our web browser can do some cool things, pre-built.
  - print text to the console.
  - prompt the User with a input box, and get the response.
  - make decisions based on conditions.
  - making http requests.
  - loosely typed => we can change what type a variable has
  - semicolons are optional, but should be consistent.

## Variables

`let name = 'Jacob';`
